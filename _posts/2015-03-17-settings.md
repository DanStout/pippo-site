Your application and modules can be configured using a simple [application.properties]({{ site.demourl }}/pippo-demo-basic/src/main/resources/conf/application.properties) text file. This file supports
mode-sensitive keys and recursive includes.

```
# Include files serve as base settings which may be overridden in this file.
include = /path/to/include.properties, /path/to/other.properties

application.name = Default Pippo Application
%dev.application.name = Developing Pippo Application
%test.application.name = Testing Pippo Application
%prod.application.name = My Pippo Application
```

If a setting provides a mode-specific variant for the current runtime mode it's value will be used.  Otherwise, the default
setting's value will be used.

There is some flexibility in specifying from where to load your _application.properties_ file.  
This is the order Pippo will use to try to resolve an _application.properties_ file:

1. `-Dpippo.settings=/path/to/application.properties` *(flexible external location)*
2. `$user.dir/application.properties` *(the working directory of your application)*
3. `conf/application.properties` *(an embedded classpath resource)*

An externally located _application.properties_ file is automatically reloaded, if modified, on the next setting access
within Pippo. This allows your Pippo application to be responsive without being restarted.

You can access programmatically your application settings using `Application.get().getPippoSettings()`.
